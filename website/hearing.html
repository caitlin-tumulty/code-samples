		<h2>A World Behind the Hearing Aids</h2>

		<p>2-year-old C.J. Suss runs and hides from his mother.  His mother searches for him all over their house; they’re playing a game of hide-and-seek.  She finds C.J. facing a glass door, his back turned to her.</p>
		<p>“C.J.!  C.J.!” she yells from five feet away.</p>
		<p>He doesn’t turn around.  He doesn’t hear her.</p>
		<p>His parents take him to the doctor who diagnoses him with Bilateral Hearing Loss.  This means he has 13 percent hearing in his right ear and 40 percent hearing in his left ear.  At two years old, C.J. begins wearing hearing aids.</p>
		<p>16 years since the diagnosis and C.J still wears hearing aids as he moves from Long Island, New York to attend James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia as a freshman Management major.</p>
		<p>In elementary school, C.J.’s peers didn’t notice his hearing impairment until he was in second and third grade.  When C.J. entered middle school, his hearing loss became more apparent. C.J. had typical concerns entering middle school: “Can I open my locker, can I get to class on time?” he wondered. But C.J. also worried about sharing his impairment with more people, concerned what they would think of it. Yet he became more comfortable with this in high school.</p>
		<p>He had concerns of starting his first year at JMU: meeting new people, navigating campus, and getting to class on time.</p>
		<p>“The social aspect and the academic, I can’t focus on the disability part of it and hold me back,” C.J. explains.  But sometimes the disability strains the social aspect of his life.  Clanging of silverware against ceramic plates and conversations between families over dinner.  Back in December, these sounds consumed C.J.’s ability to hear his friends’ conversations at the dinner table in Bella Luna, a local Harrisonburg restaurant.  He sat at the end of the table, his friends to his right, the rest of the restaurant to his left.  Unable to hear and participate in the conversation, C.J. ate his food, zoned out, and wished he was sitting at the middle of the table.</p>

		<p>Zoning out also occurs in class.  To combat this, C.J. gives an auditory amplifying necklace to his professors at the start of each class.  The necklace amplifies the voice of his professor directly to his hearing aids.  However the hearing aids are not perfect. While they pick up sounds C.J. wants to hear, they also pick up other sounds around him.  All sounds combine and interlock within the hearing aids.  C.J. might be listening to the professor and receiving the sound, but if students whisper to each other during the lecture, these side-conversations overpower the professor.  “It can be a little much at times…it can cause a lot of anger” C.J. reflects.  He can’t pick and choose what he hears.</p>

		<p>C.J. dreads approaching his professors with the auditory necklace every first class of the semester.  He gives them the necklace right before class starts as 40 pairs of unfamiliar student eyes stare at him. He avoids meeting their gazes as he sits back down.</p>
		<p>One professor took that feeling of dread away on the first day of class his first semester.  Dr. Julie Gochenour was C.J.’s professor for Individual Presentations, a class that every JMU student takes where they’re required to give three graded speeches a semester.</p>
		<p>Dr. Gochenour remembers when C.J. approached her on the first day with the auditory amplifying necklace.  She knew it was his last class of the day.  “I’m sure C.J. had already done it a number of times and had to explain it one, more, time.  That was the look I think I saw on his face,” Dr. Gochenour recalls.</p>

		<p>Dr. Gochenour saw that C.J. has to be different because he constantly has to adapt to his environment to fit his needs.  She didn’t want him to feel this difference in her class.  C.J. could hear Dr. Gochenour when she wore the necklace, however he couldn’t always hear his classmates.  If someone in the class made a comment that Dr. Gochenour thought C.J. might not hear, she made sure to repeat the comment but without singling C.J. out.  If a student made a pun, Dr. Gochenour might have responded, “Oh so-and-so that was a great pun! I never would’ve thought of comparing X to Y!” </p>
		<p>“I guess it was a matter of understanding that he has a handicap but not a matter of understanding that he’s handicapped…the handicap didn’t make him handicapped,” Dr. Gochenour explains.</p>

		<p>Dr. Gochenour made C.J. feel comfortable approaching her when he needed help in the class.  She made him want to work hard. He was excited to attend her class in the evening.  </p>
		<p>C.J.’s close group of friends also make him feel comfortable transitioning and at home in college.  They tell him that they don’t think of him as hearing impaired. “It’s definitely something that makes me much happier that I am more than just someone who wears these hearing aids,” C.J. responds.  C.J. lives on Floor Four of his dorm, also known as the loud floor.  C.J. feels that he fits in there perfectly, he’s loud himself.  He and his friends tell each other everything, they laugh a lot, they sit up late in the hallways talking and doing homework together. </p>
		<p>While C.J. might be loud, his friends know he’s upset if he gets quiet.  For C.J. to confide in people, he feels he needs to have a deep friendship with them.  JMU freshman and Biology major Nicole Bellocco is one of those friends that he knows he can confide in.  Nicole and CJ have attended school together since elementary school, but the two didn’t become close until 8th grade.  They visited JMU together, they left Long Island to attend school at JMU, they live in the same dorm, and they both miss home.  While they’re far from home, the two look out for each other.  When Nicole senses C.J. is upset, she provides a space for him to talk it out with her.  If CJ feels that Nicole is upset, he’ll text her to check up on her and remind her that he’s there if she needs anything.  C.J. and Nicole’s friendship is a reminder of home for C.J.  “It’s like that special blanket or stuffed animal, but alive and that’s priceless,” he recalls.  </p>

		<p>He sometimes gets frustrated asking people to repeat themselves and dreads informing people of his hearing impairment.  But in these challenges his professor says he is sweet and good-natured, and his friends call him selfless.  He told himself he didn’t want the disability to hold him back and in the fall of 2017 he will return to JMU to begin his second year no longer as a Management major, but as a Health Services Administration major.  He anticipates a lifetime of people asking to repeat themselves, but for now a college career filled with tight friendships and challenges meant to grow him. </p>
