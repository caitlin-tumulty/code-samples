		<h2>The Office of Disability Services</h2>
		<p>The Office of Disability Services (ODS) works with students who have disabilities to accommodate their individual needs. It has existed in a variety of capacities for about 30 years, and was officially mandated by law when the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was passed. Currently, the office provides services to over 1,000 students. According to their website, ODS’ mission is to “collaborate with the JMU community providing programs and services that support the university in creating inclusive, equitable environments that value disability, diversity and accessibility.” </p>

It was also relocated in the fall of 2014 from Wilson Hall to the new Student Success Center. Because of growth in office space after the move, ODS is able to accommodate a larger number of students. </p>

ODS’ 8th annual Disability Awareness Week was March 27-31, 2017. It included speakers, a variety of modified sporting events, and faculty training on accessible Microsoft materials. </p>
		<p>On Tuesday, March 28, a Disabled Sports Showcase was co-sponsored by UREC, the Department of Kinesiology, HART School of Hospitality, and Sport and Recreation Management. Students from the university were invited to come learn about and participate in modified sports such as beep baseball. In this game students wore a blindfold while playing baseball. The equipment beeped, using certain tones to signify before it had been hit and when it was in the field. Bases also beeped for blindfolded batters to find the bases using senses other than sight. Students were also able to experience walking blindfolded with a walking stick, relying on other senses and the instruction of their peers to maneuver around obstacles.  </p>
