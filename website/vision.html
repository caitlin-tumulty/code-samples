		<p>Meet Scarlet Racey, a JMU junior dedicated to the selfless service of others, evident in her everyday life and future goals.  This Virginia native finds her happy place in the social work department, surrounded by other compassionate individuals pursuing the same major.“I love how much people care,” she says of her classmates and professors.</p>
		<blockquote>“I love how much people care”</blockquote>
		<p>Scarlet works at the Office of Disability Services, where she is a peer access advocate and mentor, coordinates and volunteers for Disability Awareness Week, plans other awareness events, promotes self-advocacy, volunteers for JMU’s Choices and panels in high school, and serves as a liaison between ODS, the student body and Harrisonburg.  Scarlet also has six siblings, dyslexia, and glaucoma.</p>

		<p>Glaucoma is a degenerative neurological disorder which deteriorates the optic nerve in a person’s retina.  Scarlet is completely blind in her right eye, and has 20/90 vision during the day with limited peripheral vision and is therefore legally consider blind.  However, those who are considered legally blind can fall on a varying spectrum of visibility.  Her sight will decrease over time due to fluid that increases pressure in her eyes, which deteriorates the nervous system over time and thus Scarlett’s vision.</p>
		<p>With her father and younger sister who are also blind, genetics clearly played a factor in all three family members being born with cataracts that later developed into glaucoma. In fact, her entire family has either a physical or mental disability of some sort, so Scarlett considers it weird not to have a disability.  Because of this, her disability was normalized, a benefit she says most don’t get to experience.</p>
		<p>“That’s why I’m so confident in my disability,” she says, “it’s taught me to appreciate that with the same disability each one of us is different.”  She learned a great deal from her father, who understood what she was going through and taught her how to use the accessible devices he himself uses at work, such as the enlarged text cctv.   </p>
		<p>When placed in a special education class to test her academic ability in her first semester of sixth grade, teachers discovered Scarlet couldn’t read or write.  She learned how to read in third grade, but public schools proved unable to accommodate her needs after she failed English. </p>
		<p>From 2008-2014 she attended the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind.  Now she reads at the 13+ reading level and is fluent in Braille and American Sign Language. </p>
		<p>Scarlet passed up the College of William and Mary, George Mason University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Tech and Norfolk to attend James Madison University.  Her passion was social work, and JMU’s unfriendly terrain to the visually impaired proved inconsequential against her determination.  While geography can’t be changed, structures can be put in place to make navigation easier, although when quad bricks disappear, canes can get stuck and walkers can break.</p>
		<p>She grew to love the university despite its inaccessibility and size, finding the central location of her freshman home in the Village to be the perfect starting point wherever she was headed.</p>
		<p>She immediately registered with the Office of Disability Services (ODS), calling it “the best thing I ever did.” </p>
		<p>Before classes began, her assigned orientation mobility instructor Steve Ferguson helped plan her paths to classes during Frog Week.  With the aid of ODS volunteer mobility guides, she gradually learned the various routes and shortcuts to other campus destinations, as well as how to navigate the Harrisonburg Bus System.</p>
		<p>When it came to schoolwork, most professors were accommodating, though the large general education classes remained difficult.  ODS provided accessible media for Scarlet in the form of audio books and in-house Braille printing.  (She even knows a friend who is blind taking anatomy with the help of 3D-printed body parts!)  </p>
		<p>The Virginia Department for the Blind and Visually Impaired provided access to technology for those with impaired vision, examples of which includes a laptop with a screen reader, computers with sole keyboard control, digital magnifiers with a zoom function, and more.  Technology like this enables students like Scarlet to read print and online information that would have otherwise been inaccessible. </p>
		<p>Outside of classes and schoolwork, she’s actively involved in both the Madison Equality and Friends of Rachel clubs.   In her free time she does yoga, watches Avatar: The Last Airbender and colors – her fridge in her dorm room is adorned with her artwork. </p>
		<p>When it comes to people, for Scarlet’s limited vision, facial recognition is near impossible, and racial recognition almost as difficult.</p>
		<p>“I can tell someone has eyes, a nose and a mouth, but I can’t tell [their] shapes.  There are three types of blobs: pale blobs, tan blobs, and dark blobs,” she says.  </p>
		<p>The motion of a wave is one she sees and recognizes, but don’t ask her to tell you who she just waved to!  So when faces blur together, for her it’s one’s character that stands apart from the crowd.  </p>
		<p>Scarlet gets to know people based on their personality and not on their looks. She judges people through their actions and words instead. “Visual impairment is a privilege,” she says.  </p>
		<blockquote>“Visual impairment is a privilege”</blockquote>
		<p>Scarlet isn’t the only one who can recognize character though; she just received a grant to go to Colombia this summer for two weeks as an advocate of disability rights, and plans on doing the same in Jordan the following year. </p>
