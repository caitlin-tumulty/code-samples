	<h2>National Policies</h2>
	<p>Since such a significant portion of the population has one or more disabilities, the federal government has enacted several key laws to protect the rights and opportunities for persons with disabilities.</p>
	<p>The most important ones are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</li>
		<li>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990</li>
		<li>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>What the laws entail and why they are significant</h4>
	<p>According to the U.S. Department of Justice – Civil Rights Division, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits discrimination and ensures equal opportunity for persons with disabilities in employment, State and local government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and transportation.</p>
	<p>According to the U.S. Department of Education, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a law ensuring services to children with disabilities throughout the nation, specifically that they are entitled to a free appropriate public education to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living. IDEA governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to more than 6.5 million eligible infants, toddlers, children and youth with disabilities.</p>
	<p>According to the National Center for Learning Disabilities, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities, public or private, that receive federal financial assistance.</p>

		<h2>Statistics</h2>
		<p>Did you know that almost one fifth of Americans have one or more disabilities?  Whether it be communicative, mental or physical, this demographic represents a considerable portion of the American population.  Census 2000 reported 49.7 million people with a disability, but by Census 2010 that number rose to 56.7 million.  In 2000, the Census Bureau recorded 9.3 million people having a sensory disability, and in 2010: 15.7 million (although changes in survey questions allowed one to indicate severity, thus widening the former definition).</p>

	<h4>But what is a sensory disability?</h4>
	<p>The Census Bureau defines it as conditions that include blindness, deafness, severe vision or hearing impairment, and difficulty seeing or hearing.  From being legally blind and deaf to the “difficulty” category, there is a broad spectrum of ability.  Difficulty seeing is defined as experiencing difficulty reading in normal print even while wearing glasses or contacts.  Difficulty hearing is defined as experiencing difficulty hearing a normal level conversation, even while using a hearing aid.</p>
	<p>As you can see from the definition, there are different types of visibility and hearing acuity, such as the examples below.</p>
	<p>Degrees of visibility and hearing acuity:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Conductive, sensorineural, mixed hearing loss</li>
		<li>Visually impaired, legally blind and total blindness</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="subhead">Hearing Impairment</h4>
	<h5>Conductive Hearing Loss</h5>
	<p>Conductive hearing loss occurs when sound is not conducted efficiently through the outer ear canal to the eardrum and the tiny bones (ossicles) of the middle ear. Conductive hearing loss usually involves a reduction in sound level or the ability to hear faint sounds. This type of hearing loss can often be corrected medically or surgically.</p>
	<h5>Sensorineural Hearing Loss</h5>
	<p>Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when there is damage to the inner ear (cochlea), or to the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain. Most of the time, SNHL cannot be medically or surgically corrected. This is the most common type of permanent hearing loss. </p>
	<h5>Mixed Hearing Loss</h5>
	<p>Sometimes a conductive hearing loss occurs in combination with a sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). In other words, there may be damage in the outer or middle ear and in the inner ear (cochlea) or auditory nerve. When this occurs, the hearing loss is referred to as a mixed hearing loss.</p>
	<h4 class="subhead">Visual Impairment</h4>
	<h5>Visually Impaired</h5>
	<p>The American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) defines vision impairment as “a visual acuity of 20/70 or worse in the better eye with best correction, or a total field loss of 140 degrees.” Visual impairment may also be affected by limited ability to adapt to light or darkness, as well as sensitivity to light, light/dark contrasts or glare. Vision that falls between 20/200 and 20/400 is defined as severely impaired, while vision from 20/500 to 20/1000 is categorized as profoundly impaired. The Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children notes that visual impairment most commonly affects visual acuity, or the sharpness or clarity of vision, as well as visual range and color perception. </p>
	<h5>Legal Blindness</h5>
	<p>Technically, legal blindness refers to any level of vision loss that qualifies an individual for specialized education, job training, accommodating devices, disability benefits and tax exemption. Individuals who are legally blind can typically use their vision to some extent. 
According to the AFB, “the clinical diagnosis refers to a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the best possible correction, and/or a visual field of 20 degrees or less.” Visual acuity is one’s ability to distinguish objects from a certain distance, and is measured using a Snellen Eye Chart; the smallest letter visible from 20 feet away to someone with 20/200 vision is discernible from 200 feet away to an individual with average vision. Visual field is the total area (in degrees) visible to an individual when facing forward without moving their eyes from side to side.
</p>
	<h5>Total Blindness</h5>
	<p>AFB defines total blindness as the “inability to see anything with either eye.” This condition is normally caused by diseases of the eye, such as glaucoma, cataracts, Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD) and/or Stargardt’s Disease. Advanced diabetes may also contribute to total blindness. Due to the total lack of light perception, totally blind individuals may also develop Non-24, a disorder that affects daily circadian rhythm and causes them to fall asleep during the day. </p>
	<h4>So how many people with sensory disabilities attend post-secondary education?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>According to the National Federation for the Blind, approximately 3% of higher education students report having some kind of visual impairment.</li>
		<li>The National Center for Educational Statistics reports somewhere around 20,000 deaf and hard of hearing students attend post-secondary educational institutions each year.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the number of students with sensory disabilities in college or graduate school is 166,505.  See the chart below for specifics about school enrollment and education level for people with sensory disabilities.</p>
